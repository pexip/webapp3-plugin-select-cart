# Web App 3 Plugin: Template

Template that can be used to create your own Web App 3 plugin to extend its
functionality. For information more information about how to develop Web App 3
plugin, visit
[Developer Portal: Web App 3 Plugins](https://developer.pexip.com/docs/plugins/webapp-3/introduction).

## Run for development

- Install all the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm i
```

- Run the dev environment:

```bash
$ npm start
```

The plugin will be served from https://localhost:5173 (visit that page and
accept the self-signed certificates), but you should access it thought the Web
App 3 URL. You have more information about how to configure your environment in
the
[Developer Portal: Setup guide for plugin developers](https://developer.pexip.com/docs/plugins/webapp-3/setup-guide-for-plugin-developers).

## Build for production

To create a package, you will need to first install all the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm i
```

And now to create the package itself:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

Congrats! Your package is ready and it will be available in the `dist` folder.
The next step is to create a Web App3 branding and copy `dist` into that
branding.
